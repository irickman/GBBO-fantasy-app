# 🔑 How to Get Your BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN

## ✅ Current Status
- ✅ Blob storage is working on deployment
- ✅ Data is accessible at: https://szyuihqvww7iktlw.public.blob.vercel-storage.com/database/data.json
- ✅ .env.local file has been created with placeholder

## 🎯 Step-by-Step Instructions

### Method 1: Vercel Dashboard (Recommended)
1. **Go to Vercel Dashboard**: https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. **Find your project**: Look for "gbbo-fantasy" 
3. **Click on the project** to open it
4. **Go to Settings**: Click the "Settings" tab
5. **Environment Variables**: Click "Environment Variables" in the left sidebar
6. **Find the token**: Look for `BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN` 
7. **Copy the value**: Click the "Show" button and copy the token
8. **Update .env.local**: Replace the placeholder in your `.env.local` file

### Method 2: Vercel CLI (If you can install it)
```bash
# Try installing Vercel CLI
npm install -g vercel

# If that fails, try:
curl -o- https://cli.vercel.com/install.sh | bash

# Then run:
vercel env pull
```

### Method 3: Manual Token Creation
If you can't find the token, you can create a new one:
1. Go to Vercel Dashboard → Your Project → Settings → Environment Variables
2. Click "Add New"
3. Name: `BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN`
4. Value: You can generate a new one or copy from another environment
5. Environment: Select "Production" (and others if needed)

## 🧪 Test Your Setup

Once you have the token in `.env.local`, test it:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Then visit: http://localhost:3000/admin/teams

You should see the players and contestants loaded from the blob storage!

## 🔍 Current Data Status

Based on the blob storage test:
- **Players**: 1 (Bob)
- **Contestants**: 0 (needs to be populated)
- **Teams**: 3
- **Weekly Scores**: 0
- **Season Totals**: 0

The blob storage is working, but we may need to re-upload the complete dataset once you have the token set up locally.
